CSCI 412 @ NDSU - Assignment 2

A simple android app for my CSCI 412 Movile App Development elective course at NDSU.


* You must use Android Studio to create the app.
* The app must have two activities. 
* The main screen/activity should display your full name and student ID. The main screen should also have two buttons labeled Start Activity Explicitly and Start Activity Implicitly, which should use explicit and implicit intents, respectively, to start the second activity. 
* The second activity should list at least five mobile software engineering challenges. Include a button labeled Main Activity in the second activity. The button click event should display the main activity.
